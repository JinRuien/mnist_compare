# Compare descriptors and Machine Learning Algorithms for MNIST
Compare different descriptor parameter and ML approaches for MNIST, the hand-writing Digits Dataset

## MNIST Dataset
MNIST is a widely used dataset for computer vision. It has tenths of thousands of labeled digits in gray images of 28x28 pixels size.
Moreover there is a test set, it means a also large set of unlabeled images (in Kaggle) so that one can test its model.
The dataset used in this repository is from https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data.

## MNIST Classification 
One approach to perform MNIST classification is through HOG descriptors.

HOG means Histogram of Oriented Gradients. It generates a histogram of gradients of images countours and edges.
With this image descriptor we can compare images and check whether they are similar (same digit)
or not.

Machine learning algorithm takes many examples (train dataset) of digit images, digit label (the 
digit name) and the HOG descriptor of many samples and learn from it.

After learning model is created, one can predict new digits label (values) from the test dataset.

Then we compare the real values with the predicted values. With these values we calculate accuracy.
The table below shows the accuracy of each Machine Learning algorithm in this list:

 * SVM - Support Vector Machine
 * DTC - Decision Tree Classifier
 * Random Forest - a set of decision trees split for better prediction
 * (to increase soon)

And many different configurations of HOG descriptor with following parameters:

 * Orientations
 * Pixels Per Cell
 * Cells Per Block

As we can see, changing this parameters affects completely in accuracy.

With this tool one can compare image based classifications based in HOG and find the best result to 
train an actual model for its system and then predict.

## Technical Stack
* Python
* sklearn

## Usage
```
python3 eval_train_classify.py --dataset data/train.csv
```

After you selected your parameters, algorithm based in results of evaluation, you can train your dataset:
```
python3 train.py --dataset data/train.csv --model models/rf.cpickle
```

And classify the test vector:
```
python3 classify_mnist.py --model models/rf.cpickle --test data/test.csv
```
